My working directory is C:\ldgliteproject\

I've been taking notes on my build process.  Here's what I logged so far:

download and install mingw32 with msys

- download MinGW from http://www.mingw.org/download.shtml
- note: I installed mine in C:\mingw
- install a1s directed.
- make sure that C:\mingw\bin is in your PATH

download, compile and install zlib 1.2.8

- download source code from http://www.gzip.org/zlib/
- note: I placed mine in C:\ldgliteproject\zlib\ 
  (rename directory zlib128\ to zlib\)
  (navigate to zlib\ directory)
- copy win32/makefile.gcc makefile.gcc
- mingw32-make -fmakefile.gcc
- (navigate to zlib)
- cd zlib
- export "INCLUDE_PATH=../../mingw/include"
- export "LIBRARY_PATH=../../mingw/lib"
- export "BINARY_PATH=../../mingw/bin"
- make install -fmakefile.gcc (Opt)
manual move:
STATICLIB = libz.a		=> mingw/lib
IMPLIB    = libz.dll.a 	=> mingw/lib
SHAREDLIB = zlib1.dll	=> mingw/bin
		  = zlib.h   	=> mingw/include
		  = zconf.h  	=> mingw/include
		  = zlib.pc.in	=> mingw/lib/pkgconfig/zlib.pc

download, compile and install libpng 1.6.20

- download source code from http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html
- note: I placed mine in C:\ldgliteproject\lpng\
  (rename directory lpng1620 to lpng)
  (navigate to zlib)
- cd lpng
- cp scripts\makefile.gcc makefile.gcc
  (manually edit makefile.gcc as follows)
- EXEEXT =.exe
- ZLIBLIB=../../mingw/lib
- ZLIBINC=../../mingw/include
- make -fmakefile.gcc
manual move:
		= libpng.a 		=> mingw/lib
		= png.h 		=> mingw/include
		= pngconf.h		=> mingw/include
		= pngdebug.h	=> mingw/include
		= pnginfo.h		=> mingw/include
		= pngpriv.h		=> mingw/include
		= pnglibconf.h 	=> mingw/include 
		= pngstruct.h 	=> mingw/include 

download and install glut headers and libraries

- download glheaders.zip from ldglite page
- move .lib files to C:\mingw\lib\
- move .h files to C:\mingw\include\GL\

download and compile ldglite

- download ldglitesrc1_2_4src.zip from ldglite sourceforge page
- note: I put mine in C:\ldgliteproject\ldglite\
- delete the files in the ldglite\win directory.  It's older png stuff.
- not necessary, but you may want to change the "cp ldglite.exe *" commands
  to "copy ldglite.exe *"
- main.c:1874: error: too few arguments to functino 'mkdir'
  mkdir(filename); -> _mkdir(filename);
- make

Commands:
(write console to log file - including errors)
$mingw32-make -fMakefile > makelog.txt 2>&1
