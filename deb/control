Description: A program to view and edit Lego brick models stored in LDRAW format
 Ldglite is a program that lets you view and edit Lego brick models stored in
 LDRAW format. It was created by connecting the LDLite DAT file parser to an
 OpenGL rendering engine, making it portable to other operating systems. Along
 the way the L3 parser from L3P and a few nifty features from other DAT file
 viewers such as L3Lab were added or emulated. Most recently, an LEdit emulation
 mode was added. This gives you the ability to create and edit models in ldglite
 in addition to the viewing capabilities.
